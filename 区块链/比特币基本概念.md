**locktime：**One thing all signature hash types sign is the transaction’s locktime. (Called nLockTime in the Bitcoin Core source code.) The locktime indicates the earliest time a transaction can be added to the block chain.
通常被设置为0，表示transaction一创建好就马上发送到比特币网络，带locktime的transaction表示交易只有在未来locktime的某个时刻才被验证并添加到比特币网络上去。这个时间的设置保证交易者有足够的改变主意的时间。
If less than 500 million, locktime is parsed as a block height. The transaction can be added to any block which has this height or higher.
If greater than or equal to 500 million, locktime is parsed using the Unix epoch time format (the number of seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01T00:00 UTC—currently over 1.395 billion). The transaction can be added to any block whose block time is greater than the locktime.
